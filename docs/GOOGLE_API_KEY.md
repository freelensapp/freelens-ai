Once you click on the dedicated button, you should bind the API key with one of your GCP projects:

If you don't have any project, access your GCP Platform and create one:

Click on the project button, and it will show you the list of all available projects (if it is you 1st time with GCP you probably don't have any).
From here you can create a new project by clicking on the top right button:

Once you are done, go back to Google AI Studio and create the API Key for your just now created project:
